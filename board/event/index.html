                        We have lots of exciting news coming but we would first like to announce that we have a Badger Catchup happening on this Friday afternoon 5:00PM (29th)
                        
                        There will be free food and opportunity to socialise with other members of the club! We'll also be talking about exciting things coming up, reviewing the past Esports seasons, and opening things up to you for what you'd like to see from ANU Esports going forward!
                        
                        We'd love to see as many of you as possible there! So come hang out and have some fun!</div>
